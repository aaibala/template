summary: Created a database backed project inspired to track my Funko Pop collection.
---
This is an assignment that was done for my ICS 321 class, Database Systems I. The purpose of this assignment was to create a database management system (DBMS) web application. 

At the time of this project, I had a growing collection of Funko Pops. Funko Pops are collectible vinyl figurines made by the [Funko](https://www.funko.com/) company. Every couple of months, the company releases 
 as more gets released, so did my collect As a Funko Pop collector, over the years I have accumulated over 20+ figurines. 

This is why I chose to use this project as a way to keep track of my current collection and wishlist.


The plan intended for this web app was to be able a track of two collections:
