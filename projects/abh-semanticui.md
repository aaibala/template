In my software engineering class we were introduced to the beauty of [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). 

At the time of this project, the ABH home page looked like this:
<center>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/abh-1.png" width="600px"></div>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/abh-2.png" width="600px"></div>
</center>

With Semantic UI, I was able to recreate it into this:
<center>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/abh-mock1.png" width="600px"></div>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/abh-mock2.png" width="600px"></div>
</center>
