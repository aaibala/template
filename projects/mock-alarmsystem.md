In January 2018, Hawaii experienced a (thankfully) false alarm of an incoming ballistic missile, where alerts were issued statewide. A New York Times article regarding this event could be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/hawaii-missile.html).  Due to this event, it inspired a group project for a software engineering class that I took while I was in school. For this application, we were expected to create a "better" system that would decrease the chances of another mishap like this to happen again in the future. 

Not only did this project give us experience working as a team, it also allowed us to practice parts of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Planning and mockups of our application were done, which in turn led to building our application based on the mockup that was chosen. After basic HTML

Below are screenshots of an individual sending a real tsunami alert via siren, text message, and radio alerts to the Hawai'i Island.

As you will see in screenshots #5-6, real alarms would require a supervisor to be notified, who in turn will then allow
