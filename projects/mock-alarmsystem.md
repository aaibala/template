summary: A application that simulates Hawaii's emergency alert system.

A New York Times article regarding this event could be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/hawaii-missile.html).  Due to this event, it inspired a group project for a software engineering class that I took while I was in school. For this application, we were expected to create a "better" system that would decrease the chances of another mishap like this to happen again. 

Within our group, we created our own different mockups as to what we would like to
