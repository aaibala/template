This is an an assignment that was done for my ICS 111 class, using [jGRASP](http://www.jgrasp.org/). We used Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements to illustrate our Applets.

For this assignment, we specifically needed to follow the criteria below:
* Colors
  * 
  * Custom colors (using RGB values)
* Shapes
* Lines
* Fonts

Here is a sample of what the applet looked like in action:
