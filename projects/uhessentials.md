For a final project for my software engineering class, I was placed in a group to create a web application. For our web app, we designed a forum-like system for the University of Hawaii (UH). It was geared to be a question-and-answer forum for students, professors, and other UH system attendees. The idea of our application comes from our love and addiction for Reddit. Ultimately, our future vision for this web app was to have it up and running for all ten/nine campuses in the UH system. However, due to time constraints and for the sake of this project, we decided to only design our app for the UH Mānoa campus.

For this project, my contributions included creating HTML mockups for our app. I mocked up the profile and submit page (which were forms) and the home page. Additionally, I implemented a campus collection (database) for the “campus” dropdown field in the profile form. I attempted to implement a thread and topic collection that would hold all the incoming posts that would be submitted through the submit form. Unfortunately, we were not successful at getting this feature to work.

I was also in charge of deploying our app to Galaxy. And finally, because I was in charge of deploying our app, I always made sure that everything was set to go before we turned our project in.


This project was quite an experience because interestingly enough, it was my first group coding project that I had to do. I liked that I was not alone in this project, and I’m glad that this experience was not a bad one.
