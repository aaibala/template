For the past month or so, I was introduced to [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) in my software engineering class. Meteor allows us to create functioning applications with the use of command line, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and many more. We basically took everything we learned all semester, and used it all in this one toolset.

At first, Meteor was a bit of a learning curve for me, so I liked that our run with it was not jam packed into one week. Instead, we spent almost a month learning and using Meteor, each week building upon the next. It took a while for me to get used to the fact that we needed to have multiple windows of programs open for this. I would be so annoyed switching through windows of five billion different things. I'd need one for command line, a Google Chrome tab for the application, one for IntelliJ, GitHub Desktop, and then another Chrome tab for GitHub and for Googling things when I got stuck. Even though my computer screen is relatively big enough, it felt like it wasn't, since all the open windows made my screen a mess. ðŸ˜­ Additionally, in order for Meteor applications to work, you need to know how and why the code does what it needs to do. Files rely on each other. For instance, you need to understand where references of files are coming from or going to, or remember to import files in another file. If two files are needed for an event to work, then that means that both files need to be working functionally for the function event to work. It's like Stitch's saying from Lilo & Stitch. *"Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten."* If you leave an import statement behind somewhere, your application won't work the way it is supposed to. *Meteor is family. Family means don't leave an import statement left behind (or forgotten) or your app will not work.* ðŸ˜‚

Nonetheless, there were also a few things I actually did enjoy about Meteor too. The first thing? Two words--LIVE RELOAD. I'm sure this is everyone's favorite thing, and if you used Meteor I would think you would like this feature too! No more having to refresh the application ourselves (not saying its difficult or anything, but you know, it saves us a few click strokes here and there). Using Meteor shows when our application has refreshed in command line, and we can watch as the page physically reloads in Google Chrome too (my favorite, TBH). Another thing I enjoyed (but also freaked out and would get nervous about) is how if our code had an error, our application would not refresh and load, instead it would flood our command line with a million lines of error (the reason I'd freak out lol). A good thing about this? In the command line, you can get an idea of where in your files something went wrong.

Working with Meteor has literally been like a shower...a meteor shower ðŸš¿ (*ba dum tssss* for the pun ðŸ˜‚). I've had several different types of Meteor showers so far. Here, are two of them:
- *Bad shower days* aka the days when its all cold water. On this day, Meteor just was not working for me. At all. It was a struggle.
- Then there are those days *where you think everything is going great*, the water is just the way you like it, and then you're finished. But then you realize you forgot your towel. On these days, I thought everything was going well. Command line was all good. My application is running, that's all good. OK, but where is this page that I made????? Oh that's right, I forgot to import it in my ```index.js```.

Overall, despite the obstacles and ups and downs with Meteor, it was great to work with. Unlike our play with Semantic UI, the applications we made *actually* worked. With Semantic UI, all it felt like we were doing was designing. That's great and all, but there was always a sense of accomplishment when the Meteor applications we made had actually worked and functionally did something.
