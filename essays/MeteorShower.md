For the past month or so, I was introduced to [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) in my software engineering class. Meteor allows us to create full functioning applications with the use of command line, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and many more. We basically took everything we learned all semester, and used it all in this one toolset.

At first, Meteor was a bit of a learning curve for me. For starters, it took a while for me to get used to the fact that we needed to have multiple windows of programs open for this. I would be so annoyed switching through windows of five billion different things. I'd need one for command line, a Google Chrome tab for the application, one for IntelliJ, GitHub Desktop, and then another Chrome tab for GitHub and for Googling things when I got stuck. Even though my computer screen is relatively big enough, it felt like it wasn't, since all the windows felt like my screen was a mess. ðŸ˜­

Nonetheless, there were also a few things I actually did enjoy about Meteor too. The first thing? Two words--LIVE RELOAD. I'm sure this is everyone's favorite thing, and if you used Meteor I would think you would like this feature too! No more having to refresh the application ourselves (not saying its difficult or anything, but you know, it saves us a few click strokes here and there). Using Meteor shows when our application has refreshed in command line, and we can watch as the page physically reloads in Google Chrome too (my favorite, TBH). Another thing I enjoyed (but also freaked out about) is how if our code had an error, our application would not refresh and load, instead it would flood our command line with a million lines of error (the reason I'd freak out lol).
