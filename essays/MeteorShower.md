For the past month or so, I was introduced to [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) in my software engineering class. Meteor allows us to create full functioning applications with the use of command line, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Semantic UI, MongoDB, and many more. We basically took everything we learned all semester, and used it all in this one toolset.

At first, Meteor was a bit of a learning curve for me. For starters, it took a while for me to get used to the fact that we needed to have multiple windows of programs open for this. I would be so annoyed switching through windows of five billion different things. I'd need one for command line, a Google Chrome tab for the application, one for IntelliJ, GitHub Desktop, and then another Chrome tab for GitHub and for Googling things when I got stuck. Even though my computer screen is relatively big enough, it felt like it wasn't, since all the windows felt like my screen was a mess. ðŸ˜­
