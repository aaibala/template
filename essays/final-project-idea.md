# Project Idea: 

## Overview
*The problem:* Sick of on campus dining? Sick of your dorm residence hall food? Well there are a lot of eateries around the Manoa area, and elsewhere to eat!

*The solution:* This application is like Yelp, but with UH Manoa community opinions!

Similar to Yelp, but only for UH system wide individuals:
- Users need a login that uses their UH credentials.
- Admin controls content of application (inappropriate posts, comments will be removed).

## Mockup page ideas
- Public landing page
- Create an account/login page
- Login page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page
- Food categories page (to choose what kind of food)
- Foods by location
- Most popular food locations
- Individual food locations pages

## Use case ideas
- Users can see home page, which is the public landing page, and public
- If users want to add to the application, they need to make an account, log in, submit a post.
- User profile pages show posts that the user has submitted in their profile for others to see.

## Beyond the basics
- Messaging/Commenting system to comment on posts (ex. "Ouu that looks good!")
- Notification of specials in different food locations (ex. Advertising that there are BOGO specials, 2/$5, etc.)
- An algorithm that will show locations based on search options or other places similar to places a user has posted about (ex. if a user searches or posts about a Crepe place, similar locations that sell Crepes will be shown)
- A following page that allows user to follow other users to keep track of their food posts
