In one of my first few computer science classes, one of my professors emphasized that *“Google is your best friend.”* And in indeed, Google definitely is our best friend. Whenever we have a question we need answered, 99.95% Google has the answer. If we have an iPhone, Siri sometimes has the answers we need too.

There are a lot of smart questions, however there are even more dumb questions. It doesn’t help that going through school, our professors always say that it’s okay to ask questions and that there is no such thing as a *dumb* question. Well they lied, there are such things as a dumb question. Google alone shows how much of a dumb question people can ask. When I typed “How do I…” into Google, the second top searched item was “How do I get home?”. How would Google know how to get *you* home?? 

## So then, what is a "dumb" question?


## What is considered a smart question?
