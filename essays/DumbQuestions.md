In one of my first few computer science classes, one of my professors emphasized that *“Google is your best friend.”* And in indeed, Google definitely is our best friend. Whenever we have a question we need answered, 99.95% Google has the answer. If we have an iPhone, Siri sometimes has the answers we need too.

Contrary to what we are told, there are dumb questions. It doesn’t help that going through school, our professors always say that it’s okay to ask questions and that there is no such thing as a *dumb* question. Well they lied, there is such thing as a dumb question. Google alone shows how much dumb questions people ask. When I typed “How do I…” into Google, the second top searched item was “How do I get home?”. How would Google know how to get *you* home?? 


After reading Eric Steven Raymond’s *How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*, he shows that there are ways to hide our dumb and stupid questions just by appropriately asking our questions correctly, aka the smart way. If you want to read more on this, you can find it [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

## So then, what is a "dumb" question?
For a question to be “dumb” and non-smart, shows that we haven’t even attempted to find the answer to the question ourselves. It is important that you at least attempt to find the answer on your own. You need to put in some sort of effort, which can be done simply by doing your own search for the answer. This includes using Google or re-reading whatever resources are applicable for your question. For example, if you are trying to find a certain event date, try looking for the e-mail or post you initially saw about it. If you are lucky enough, you also may know someone that can help to answer your question or already knows the answer. If possible, seek help from them. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42855224/how-to-add-rgb-values-into-setcolor-in-java) is an example of a non-smart question from Stack Overflow. The question is straight to the point, a clear sign that the user was just looking for an answer. Although it does receive a successful answer, you can see that another user attempted to help, but felt that the question did not have enough detail to what kind of answer he/she was looking for. This type of question could have easily been answered if the user did a little more effort to search for an answer themselves.

## What is considered a smart question?
They’re questions that you show you have put some sort of effort in, before searching for the answer in someone else. You need to show your attempts in finding the answer to your question. Let the person know of your attempts simply by elaborating on your question, and what outcomes you got from attempting to find the answers yourself. If someone answers your question and helps you, be sure to let them know that their help actually helped you! First of all, its polite. And second, don’t leave them hanging on whether or not their help was beneficial or not. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array) is an example of a question asked the smart way. You can see that the user attempted to find the answer for his/her question. They asked a question about a C++ concept, and went further to find an answer by doing so in Java. When that didn’t help, that is when they sought for help on Stack Overflow.

## Continue to ask questions. Just do so the *smart* way. 
I admit, there are times when I’m too scared to ask questions because I don’t want to sound stupid. I’m sure there are people that feel this way too. Although it is normal to feel this way, sometimes, we just need to suck it up and seek the answers we need. *It’s okay to ask questions.* I’m not saying that you shouldn’t. Just be sure that before you seek help from others, it’s important that you try to find the answer on your own too. Put in some effort, and don’t be lazy! Don’t waste another person’s time just because you were lazy to find the answer on your own. If all else fails, then ask for help. And maybe, if you play your cards right, you could hide your “stupid” questions the smart way.
