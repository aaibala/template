In one of my first few computer science classes, one of my professors emphasized that *“Google is your best friend.”* And in indeed, Google definitely is our best friend. Whenever we have a question we need answered, 99.95% Google has the answer. If we have an iPhone, Siri sometimes has the answers we need too.

Contrary to what we are told, there are dumb questions. It doesn’t help that going through school, our professors always say that it’s okay to ask questions and that there is no such thing as a *dumb* question. Well they lied, there is such thing as a dumb question. Google alone shows how much dumb questions people ask. When I typed “How do I…” into Google, the second top searched item was “How do I get home?”. How would Google know how to get *you* home??

After reading Eric Steven Raymond’s *How To Ask Question The Smart Way*, he shows that there are ways to hide our dumb and stupid questions just by appropriately asking our questions correctly, aka the smart way. If you want to read more on this, you can find it [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

## So then, what is a "dumb" question?


## What is considered a smart question?
