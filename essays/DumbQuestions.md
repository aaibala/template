In one of my first few computer science classes, one of my professors emphasized that *“Google is your best friend.”* And in indeed, Google definitely is our best friend. Whenever we have a question we need answered, 99.95% Google has the answer. If we have an iPhone, Siri sometimes has the answers we need too.

Contrary to what we are told, there are dumb questions. It doesn’t help that going through school, our professors always say that it’s okay to ask questions and that there is no such thing as a *dumb* question. Well they lied, there is such thing as a dumb question. Google alone shows how much dumb questions people ask. When I typed “How do I…” into Google, the second top searched item was “How do I get home?”. How would Google know how to get *you* home?? 


After reading Eric Steven Raymond’s *How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*, he shows that there are ways to hide our dumb and stupid questions just by appropriately asking our questions correctly, aka the smart way. If you want to read more on this, you can find it [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

## So then, what is a "dumb" question?
For a question to be “dumb” and non-smart, shows that we haven’t even attempted to find the answer to the question ourselves. It is important that you at least try to find the answer yourself. You need to put in some sort of effort, don’t be lazy! You can try to find the answers simply by re-reading whatever resources are applicable for your question. For example, if you are trying to find a certain event date, try looking for the e-mail or post you initially saw about it. If you are lucky enough, you also may know someone that can help to answer your question or already knows the answer. If possible, seek help from them. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42855224/how-to-add-rgb-values-into-setcolor-in-java) is an example of a non-smart question from Stack Overflow. The question is straight to the point, a clear sign that they are just looking for an answer. Although it does receive a successful answer, you can see that another user attempted to help, but felt that the question did not have enough detail to what kind of answer he/she was looking for. This type of question could have easily been answered if the user did a little more effort to search for an answer themselves.

## What is considered a smart question?

## Continue to ask questions. Just do so the *smart* way. 
I admit, there are times when I’m too scared to ask questions because I don’t want to sound stupid. I’m sure there are people that feel this way too. Although it is normal to feel this way, sometimes, we just need to suck it up and seek the answers we need. Whenever you feel like a question you have is a stupid one, step back and try to seek the answer yourself. Use Google, seek answers from a friend. It’s important that you try to find the answer yourself, before seeking help from others. Put in some effort, and don’t be lazy! If all else fails and you play your cards right,
