As a little girl, I loved anything that had to do with art. My parents supported this passion by providing me with crayons, markers, paint—anything I needed to fulfill my artistic needs. This is a painting I did in the 1st grade. Till this day, it’s still framed on a wall in our home. But, slowly and surely, my need for art began to phase out because I felt that my artistic abilities sucked compared to others. I did, however find a love for design from a graphics design class I took in high school and the making of my senior project website.

Computer and video games also hold a huge part of my life and heart. One of the first computer games I played was a Lilo and Stitch game called *626 Sandwich Stacker*. I was hooked from the start, and that was only the beginning of my love for playing games. I juggled between computer games and videos games. I liked playing on our Nintendo DS Lite, Wii, and PlayStation. But I also loved to play PC role-play games like MapleStory. Just recently, I got a New Nintendo 2DS XL. I've been looking into getting a Nintendo Switch too, but sadly it's *always* sold out. Not only do I enjoy playing video games, but the graphics and structure interests me too.

My interest in computer science comes full circle because of these loves. I’m happy I found a balance that will allow me to do it all—art, design, and technology. In addition, it somehow finds its way to get my creative juices flowing. With our generation being so immersed in technology, this sparked my interest into computer science even more.

It’s interesting to think that computer science isn’t just all about the tech, science, or math. Computer science does have its way of being artsy too. One day, I hope to create fully-functioning apps and websites. I hope that this software engineering class helps me to improve the skills I already have, and teach me new skills I don’t already have. I came into this major as a first-time programmer. I knew a bit of HTML/CSS, so it was nice to have built some skill in Java, C/C++, and now JavaScript.

I can't wait to see what type of projects I dive into next!
