I came into this major as a first-time programmer. I knew a bit of HTML/CSS back when MySpace was still a thing, but other than that, I didn’t know much of anything else. As I was learning Java for my ICS 111 class (which also was my first computer science class), I struggled since it was my first time doing any *legit* coding. I felt very discouraged since it seemed like everyone else had programmed before. It just showed that I needed to work harder to understand the language and get my assignments done. 

With JavaScript, I felt more confident and comfortable to learn it since I had that programming experience I lacked previously. Many of the basic concepts overlap between the various languages, however they did have their differences. For example, JavaScript allows us to create variables of any type without being specific. For instance, I could say ```let word = “Hello”;``` to assign the string Hello to a variable called word. But with Java, I would have to be specific and say ```String word = “Hello”;```. I liked having the freeCodeCamp JavaScript assignment since it gave us an opportunity to learn the basics of the language, if we didn’t know it yet. It gave us the practice we needed, before we actually jumped into our assignments. With previous classes, it was as if the professor just assumed we all knew how to code, and just assigned chapters in our textbook for us to review. Personally, I learn best with practice, not just reading.

The first WOD was honestly *super* nerve racking for me. I know that as the semester goes by things will get better as I get used to this routine, but for this first one, I felt so nervous that I honestly blanked out. This is a normal thing for me, since sometimes my nervousness overcomes my ability to function properly. I also don’t work too well under pressure, so that is probably why. Hopefully as we do more WODs, I can overcome this feeling since I will get used to it eventually. With more practice, I know I’ll be able to do better on future WODs.
