Semantic UI has been so fun to work with. For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to design a website from scratch...and with Semantic UI I was finally able to fulfill that want. It'll only get better from here (or at least I hope it will ðŸ˜‰).

The deal with Semantic UI is that we get to fix basic, plain, non-aesthetically pleasing pages likes this...

</center>
and turn them into this!

[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) provides software engineers for a numerous amount of UI elements to use in their pages. For example, there are...
- dropdowns
- menus
- icons <i class="hashtag icon"></i><i class="hand peace icon"></i>,
- cards
- buttons <button class="ui inverted mini grey button"><a href="https://static.pexels.com/photos/39317/chihuahua-dog-puppy-cute-39317.jpeg">Click for something cute!</a></button>
- and many more.


I've heard a bunch of mixed feelings about Semantic UI. Some don't care much for the looks that it can give, and rather stick to basic HTML/CSS. And others are the exact opposite. Personally, I like the look and feel of pages that don't look so basic, and non-effortless.
