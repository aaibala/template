Ethics in software engineering go far beyond the realm of using or “borrowing” someone else’s code, or taking credit for work that is not even yours. Without ethics in software engineering, can we fully put our trust in an application that was made?

The thing with ethics is that, to different people, it may mean different things. For example, a doctor has different ethical standards to follow that are not necessarily the same as a grocery store clerk. In addition, many throw around ethics and morals as if they are the same thing, when they are not. In actuality, ethics can be seen as rules that you should adhere to. Morals, on the other hand, are what you personally feel is right or wrong.
