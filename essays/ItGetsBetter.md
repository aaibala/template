I came into this major as a first-time programmer. I knew a bit of HTML/CSS back when MySpace was still a thing, but other than that, I didn’t know much of anything else. As I was learning Java for my ICS 111 class, I struggled since it was my first time doing any *legit* coding. I felt very discouraged since it seemed like everyone else had programmed before. It just showed that I needed to work harder to understand the language and get my assignments done. 

With JavaScript, I felt more confident and comfortable to learn it since I got that programming experience I needed. Many of the basic concepts overlap between the various languages, however they did have their differences. For example, JavaScript allows us to create variables of any type without being specific. For instance, I could say ```let word = “Hello”;``` to assign the string Hello to a variable called word. But with Java, I would have to be specific and say ```String word = “Hello”;``` I liked having the freeCodeCamp JavaScript assignment since it gave us an opportunity to learn the basics of the language, if we didn’t know it yet. It gave us the practice we needed, before we actually jumped into our assignments. With previous classes, it was as if the professor just assumed we all knew how to code, and just assigned chapters in our textbook to review. Personally, I learn best with practice, not just reading.

The first WOD was nerve racking! I know that as the semester goes by, they won’t be, but for this first one, I felt so nervous that I blanked out. Till this day, I still get these feelings of nervousness during tests, especially when I see that a lot of people have finished. I don’t work well under pressure, so that is probably why. Hopefully as we do more WODs, I can overcome this feeling.
