I came into this major as a first-time programmer. I knew a bit of HTML/CSS back when MySpace was still a thing, but other than that, I didn’t know much of anything else.

It just showed that I needed to work harder to understand the language and get my assignments done. 

With JavaScript, I felt more confident and comfortable to learn it since I got that programming experience I needed. Many of the basic concepts overlap between the various languages, however they did have their differences. For example, JavaScript allows us to create variables of any type without being specific. For instance, I could say ```let word = “Hello”; ``` to reference the string Hello to the variable word. But with Java, I would have to be specific and say ```String word = “Hello”; ```

I liked that we had the freeCodeCamp JavaScript assignment as a mandatory homework so that we could learn the basics of the language if we didn’t know it yet. It gave us the practice we needed, before we actually jumped into our assignments. With previous classes, it felt like the professor assumed we knew the language,
