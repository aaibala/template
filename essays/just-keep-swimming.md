Growing up, I was always so clueless of what I wanted to do in life. As a little youngin’, I loved anything that had to do with art. My parents supported this passion by providing me with crayons, markers, paint—anything I needed to fulfill my artistic needs. This is a painting I did in the 1st grade. Till this day, it’s still framed on wall in our home.

I’m glad I found something that will allow me to do it all—art, design, and technology.
